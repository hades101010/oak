						<strong>Struggling to choose a course? So did many of us!</strong> <br>	
						Each course is a unique mix of many different ingredients — from the subjects covered, to the campus location, to the career it leads to. Whether you’re still considering possible courses, tossing up between two fields of study or have no idea what kind of career you want, we can help find the best course for you and coordinate your university application.<br><br>


					</p>
					<h3>Here’s how to start on finding the right course for you:</h3>
					<p>
						<strong>Find out your strengths and interests</strong> <br>

						Note down a list of your interests and skills, and spend some time reflecting upon it. Highlight the ones that seem promising enough to pursue as a career and eliminate options that fulfil only as a side hobby. A shorter, more focussed list of options will put you in a better position to figure out what courses will suit you the best.<br><br>

						For instance, if you are good with numbers, you can opt for courses in accounting or economics. Similarly, you are inclined towards the healthcare sector, physical therapy, nursing and pathology makes for great choices.<br><br>

						<strong>Research extensively</strong><br>

						It is important to make a well-informed decision to get the most out of your study abroad experience. You can start with our course search to explore the avenues available for you.<br><br>

						Once done with your selection, look at the qualifications required to pursue it. Do you have them all? If not, would you want to wait another intake until you achieve the requirements, or switch your stream – think about this thoroughly. This could be a tricky choice, but we can help here.<br><br>

						Our experienced counsellors are experts at understanding your study goals and finding the course that best matches your career aspirations. You can always walk in to your nearest Oak Consultation office and book a free counselling session to discuss in detail. We’d be more than happy to help.<br><br>

						<strong>Course prospects</strong><br>

						Course selection, check. Now what? See what the course has to offer in terms of the career you have planned for yourself. Take the time to visit each university or college website to explore not only the subjects included in your course but also to find out the content of each module per subject, along with the duration for which it is being offered. Remember, the course duration also depends on the type of course you wish to pursue.<br><br>

						<strong>How do you prefer to study?</strong>	<br>

						This may seem like a minor point, but trust us, it matters. It is important to know what kind of teaching methodology you are most comfortable with. Do you prefer writing long assignments all through the year or hands-on training befits you? This will also help you narrow your selection to the institutes that offer your preferred course across destinations. <br><br>

						<strong>Career opportunities</strong>	<br>

						Your chosen course should put you on a path to a profession you’ll love, but first you need to be clear what it is that you are seeking. For instance, if you wish to make it big in civil engineering, New Zealand is one of the best destinations for you. With the current expansion of construction projects across the country, there is a growing demand for civil engineers with handsome perks here.<br><br>

						If you are unable to decide, go for courses with broader career prospects, like communications or psychology. The concepts are universal and these can be applied in an array of industries to thrive well.<br><br>

						Remember, your Oak Consultation counsellor can always advice you on the course that can get you where you want to be.<br><br>

						<strong> Still confused?</strong><br>

						We, at Oak Consultation, organise many education fairs at our offices from time to time where in representatives from top universities and colleges come down to interact with you personally. You can speak with them directly and ask all your queries on course selection, application procedures, fee waivers, offer acceptance, tuition fee, scholarships and internships, and life on/off campus. Check the latest events in your city.
